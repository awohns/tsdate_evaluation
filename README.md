# Code for "Efficient Dating of Ancestors in Genealogical Networks with Modern and Ancient Samples"

This repo is the home for code used in "Efficient Dating of Ancestors in Genealogical Networks
with Modern and Ancient Samples." Analyses include: validation of tsdate's accuracy on simulated and real
data, applications of tree sequence inference and dating algorithms to various datasets, 
and code to produce all non-schematic plots in the paper.

The all-data directory contains all code for downloading and preparing data.

src contains scripts to run analyses.

tools contains methods used to compare the accuracy of tsinfer and tsdate.
